**Site login and registration application**


*In the site login and registration application, users need to enter their username and password to access the site. 
Upon clicking the login button, the system checks the accuracy of the entered credentials. If the username and password do not match, users will be redirected to the registration page.
New users can also register by clicking the register button if they haven't already done so.*
